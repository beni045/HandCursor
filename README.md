**IN PROGRESS**

# HandCursor
Two parts to this project
- A C++ implementation of hand tracking based off [MediaPipe Hands models. ](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1yiPfkhb4hSbXJZaSq9vDmhz24XVZmxpL/preview)
This is for education, optimization and easier implementation on a range of embedded devices.
- A gesture recognition module that that turns the camera feed into a cursor-like user interface tool.
